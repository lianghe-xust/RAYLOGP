# RAYLOGP
A physicochemical descriptor-based method for the estimation of the octanol-water partition coefficient, logP, submitted for the 2019 SAMPL6 LogP Prediction Challenge (https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL6/tree/master/physical_properties/logP).

This repository contains the experimental files used to compare different ways of representing a molecule in-silico for the development of quantitative structure-property relationships used to estimate logP.

The overall best model, codenamed 'RAYLOGP', was used to generate predictions for 11 protein kinase inhibitor fragment-like molecules as part of the SAMPL6 Challenge. Our submission ID was 'hdpuj'.
