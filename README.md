# RAYLOGP
A physicochemical descriptor-based method for the estimation of the octanol-water partition coefficient, logP, submitted for the 2019 SAMPL6 LogP Prediction Challenge.

This repository contains the experimental files used to compare different molecular representations to determine the one most suitable for modelling logP quantitative structure-property relationships.

The overall best model, codenamed 'RAYLOGP', was used to generate predictions for 11 protein kinase inhibitor fragment-like molecules as part of the SAMPL6 Challenge.
